 Detailed Explanation of the Changes:
 
  1. The base case in the original code is correct: 
    if (n == 0) { return 0; }
     - This correctly handles the simplest case where there are no values to sum.
  
  2. The recursive case in the original code has an error:
     return n + sum(n);
     - This causes infinite recursion because the argument to sum() never changes.
     - The method will keep calling itself with the same value of n, leading to a stack overflow.
  
  3. The corrected recursive case should be:
     return n + sum(n - 1);
     - This decreases the value of n by 1 with each recursive call.
     - It ensures that the recursion progresses towards the base case.
     - For example, if n is 3, the method calls will be:
       sum(3) -> 3 + sum(2) -> 3 + 2 + sum(1) -> 3 + 2 + 1 + sum(0)
     - When n reaches 0, the base case is triggered, returning 0.
     - The recursion then unwinds, adding the values back up: 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
  
  These changes ensure that the method correctly computes the sum of values from 0 to n using recursion.
